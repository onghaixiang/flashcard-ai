This was created as part of Poe's Hackathon #1.

This product aims to create and host a chatbot on Poe that is capable of creating flashcards from document dumps or pdf files. This product then uses a spaced repetition algorithm to space out the flashcards based on the user's scored attempts. The chatbot will continue generating messages until the user has cleared all the flashcards.
